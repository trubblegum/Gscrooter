Gscrooter is a super awesome platform shooter for LÖVE, inpired by Gewter (see below), but rebuilt from the ground up.

Kill the stuff! Count the hoppers! Protect your tree! Survive! Make your own levels! And more! (not really .. that's all for now)

The first commit was completed in under 24 hours :)

The first line in level.lvl is the floor, which defines the level's bounds (entity level objects wrap to level bounds)
Object defs in level1.lvl are minimal, but you can customize any object by adding attributes to the prototype
Some example objects :
- platform {p = {x = 0, y = 0, w = 128, h = 0}}
- healtree {p = {x = 0, y = 0}, healing = 8}
- hopper {{p = {x = 0, y = 128}, hp = 100, damage = 64}
- hopperspawn {}
- buzzer {}
- buzzerspawn {}
